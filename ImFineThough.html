<h1>Quarantine Thoughts:</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>I wish I didn't have to make any choices. All of my choices are wrong.</p>
  <p>This is a message to that creaky old floorboard in my house: I will step on you!</p>
  <p>I'm so overwhelmed I can't move. I don't want to be seen by them so I can't move. I can't move because I have too much to do. I can't move because I'm crying.</p>
  <p>I go to sleep at night listening to a playlist of classic Dance Dance Revolution songs and J-Metal bands.</p>
  <p>One weird thing about growing up poorer than my classmates was always being the person that lived at the bottom of the valley and having to drive up to see them. Also not wearing uggs or drinking v8 juice. Or owning the 1st iphone when it came out.</p>
  <p>I want to do what I was meant to be doing, getting out of people's way.</p>
  <p>I feel like I'm not Jewish enough because I don't know what bagel to order and the only way I know how to be Jewish is to fit into a cultural stereotype.</p>
  <p>I said something that in hindsight was stupid and embarrassing. They will never forgive me, and I am a terrible person. I will never speak to them again.</p>
